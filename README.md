# 💰 ML-Based-Income-Prediction-System

## ❓ Problem
Financial institutions need to know whether a person earns more than 50,000 USD per year to make decisions about loans, credit, and risk assessment. Manually checking this for every individual is slow and error-prone.

## 💡 Solution
We built a Machine Learning system that predicts a person’s income category (<=50K or >50K) using demographic and work-related data (age, education, occupation, hours per week, etc.). The system cleans and preprocesses the data, trains models like **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression**, and evaluates their accuracy.

## 🎯 Outcome
The system can automatically predict income levels, helping organizations make fast and accurate financial decisions. Users can also try the prediction through a simple interactive frontend built with **Streamlit**.
